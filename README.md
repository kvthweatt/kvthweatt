## Howdy ðŸ‘‹

My name is Karac, for a day job and most of my working career I've worked the restaurant and bar industry.

At night I become programmer, creator of tools. My biggest project to date is a multi-purpose cryptocurrency

bot for Discord (cross platform + API ***--planned--***) called **UTTCex**. It features the ability to swap, stake,

escrow, loan, auto trade, and more crypto features, as well as being privacy oriented.

Inspired by [Tip.CC](https://tip.cc/) and formerly a swap bot built *for Tip.CC*, it has since evolved to be capable

of wallet management and no longer relies on any external bots. You may build your own bot *for UTTCex* as

UTTCex was done for Tip.CC, and your swap rates will be independent of UTTCex's rates, all the time.
